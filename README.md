# Recruitify

Recruitify is a modern web-based job portal built for efficiency and simplicity. It empowers recruiters to automate candidate screening and enables candidates to showcase their profiles with ease. Featuring intelligent resume parsing and skill-matched feeds, Recruitify helps reduce downtime and streamlines job discovery for both recruiters and job seekers.

## 🚀 Features

- **Automatic Resume Parsing & ATS Sorting**  
  Candidates' resumes are auto-parsed and sorted based on advanced ATS (Applicant Tracking System) algorithms, letting recruiters focus on the best-fit profiles instantly.

- **Skill-Based Feed Filtering**  
  Candidates only see jobs that precisely match the skills they possess, eliminating irrelevant listings and doom scrolling.

- **Secure Resume Storage**  
  Candidates can upload and manage PDFs of their resumes securely. Recruiters can fetch resumes for screening and download as needed.

- **Role-Based Dashboards**  
  Separate dashboards for recruiters and candidates, ensuring specialized workflows and seamless experiences.

- **Google OAuth & JWT Authentication**  
  Secure sign-in options with Google OAuth, refresh tokens for session management, and robust password reset flows.

- **Real-Time Application Status**  
  Both candidates and recruiters get live updates on application statuses, feedback, and onboarding next steps.
